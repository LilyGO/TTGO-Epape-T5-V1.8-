# Description
The following example shows how to use DHT sensor with deep sleep option.


# Arduino settings
	* Install ESP32 core
	* Install DHT sensor library by Adafruit version 1.2.3 (version 1.3.0 has internal issues)
	* Install EPD display drivers from example epd2in13-demo
	
# Hardware
	* Connect DHT22 sensor to dev board (VCC: 3.3V, signal to GPIO21)
	* Remember to add resisor between VCC and data pin of DHT22 (5,1k is OK)
